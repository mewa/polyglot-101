# Polyglot 101
This repository contains examples used throughout my article on [polyglot machine code](https://mewa.github.io/articles/2017-07/polyglot-assembly-101)

# Running examples
This repository contains a `Makefile` that should let you recreate the polyglot created in that article. 

To build the polyglot simply run
```sh
make
```

To test whether it's working
```sh
make test
```
